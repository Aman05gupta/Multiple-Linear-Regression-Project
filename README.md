# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Project

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The goal is to understand how the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.

Key Concepts
Dependent Variable (Y): The outcome variable you are trying to predict.
Independent Variables (X1, X2, ..., Xn): The predictor variables used to predict the dependent variable.
